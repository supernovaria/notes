# Marine Life

## Cephalopods

### Star-Sucker Pygmy Octopus
The smallest known octopus, less than 2.5cm (1 in) and it weighs less than 1g. Due to its size, the Star-Sucker Pygmy Octopus spends over half their life floating near the surface living amongst and feeding on plankton.

### Coconut Octopus

very smart and hide in shells they find

  

### Cuttlefish

Look cute and cute name; have the best stealth stats of any animal: can change texture, shape, color and can even flash their color changes to hypnotize and confuse other animals. And they still have the ink-jet ability too.

## Other

### Leaf Sheep
These sea slugs have the ability _kleptoplasty_; when eating algae they  incorporate the chloroplast into their body and get their energy from photosynthesis :O
