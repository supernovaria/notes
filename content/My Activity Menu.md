## Sports & Active Activities
- ~~Rapier fencing practice~~  Monster Huntress Training
- I enjoy doing basic school sports type stuff w friends as an activity to do together, but don't care about these for themselves much
	- badminton 
	- volleyball 
	- table tennis
	- beach ball
	- etc
- Frisbee (or frisbee rings)
- I tend to enjoy a friendly back-and-forth more than full-on and serious competition, but if the skill levels are close enough I can enjoy them too
- Inline skating (gotta try ice skating still)
- Enjoyed but too expensive (and natural resource intensive): 
	- skiing
	- golf
- Aspirational: 
	- free running (urban or in nature)

## Games
- Board Games: 
	- most friends I have are only into the most basic, rules light types, but would be happy to also try more rules heavy games 
	- my neck injury will likely limit the duration I can play per session without doing non-desk activities 
	- I usually prefer team-based (team A vs team B or players vs game) games
	- I can't play social deduction games 
	- I also like to learn historical board games like Tafl/Hefnatafl or Royal Game of Ur
- TTRGPs
	- most familiar w 5e, a bit w pathfinder 2e
	- would love to try out various systems
	- I have copies of soo many systems 😅
- Flat-Screen Video Games
	- I don't play myself so much anymore, last things were LiS: True Colors, Celeste
	- w friends: 
		- coop games
		- FPS (eg overwatch)
		- open to try pretty much any non-horror game
- VR Games (quest 3)
	- would like to try multiplayer w friends
- Escape rooms
- Laser tag (haven't yet tried paintball)

## Art Engangement
- Book discussions (although I mostly listen to things and if it's been a while I'll probably not be able to come up w interesting things on the spot; don't have much experience w it but I enjoyed my _weird ecologies: queering nature_ literature class at uni; see [[Weird-Ecologies-1]])
- Urban sketching; digital or ink + water colors
- Occasionally digital art or design stuff, when my muse holds me hostage
	- designing logos mostly, have also done stickers and a font
- Trying other art things (although need motivation)
- Interested in learning more about prose and fiction writing
- Museums: no, unless interactive or otherwise better than just watching a documentary on the topic (I do not accept standing in front of signs, reading them and looking at some item behind glass as a free time activity anymore! and so many museums have great videos done by their curators and conservators now); see also [[Why I don't like Museums]] 
- Movies (and anything that has the same genres)
	- Documentaries
	- Adventure movies 
	- Heist movies
	- Also other kinds, see Media I enjoyed 
	- Not so into romance, but if done in novel or queer ways I'm happy to try
	- I prefer sub 2h movies
	- I have higher quality requirements for anything serial 
	- I don't like
		- horror: NO! I'll have nightmares for years to come :((
		- marvel: haven't watched their stuff for a while, but I've been bored by their all-spectacle approach
		- reality tv

	- starting to figure out what I'll _actually_ do after my masters and what to dedicate my 80kh to
	- figuring who I am and who I wanna be(come), what is important in life (and life parts like relationships)


## Other & Misc
- generally prefer smaller groups and 1-1 settings over medium to large groups (although large groups often tend to cluster into smaller groups again); the better I know the people, the larger the group can be
